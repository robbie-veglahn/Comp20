Name of business:
inQ

What does business do:
inQ would be a video chat application similar to Omegle, but with far more...
regulations/standards and a social networking aspect. inQ would be a way to...
meet new people virtually and in a socially distant fashion, while still...
providing a fun way to make connections with others. You could add a friend...
you met and connect again, unlike Omegle.

Who is target demographic:
18-24 year olds during the Covid Pandemic

Note to grader:
I made sure to check w/ prof Diorio first, but I did use Bootstrap cdn to...
help w/ responsive resize. I also used it to help with the overall look of...
the navigation bar, but I still implemented/designed all components/graphics...
myself.
A separate note, but I didn't implement all the functionality/buttons that...
appear on the site yet â€“ for example, I haven't mapped buttons onto the...
graphic I designed for the homepage!
